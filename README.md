"# Habi_Project" 

In 2017-2018, I spent 2 years for my mandatory military service. I worked for Habi-school (A care-giver for teenagers).
At that time, I made various programming classes for the kids(Python, Scratch, Arduino, etc). It was great time for me to see how much kids have interested in the programming.

Also, I automated all kinds of time-consuming documentations. It helped minimizing most of useless efforts to writh down the documents and reports
